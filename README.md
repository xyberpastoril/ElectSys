# ElectSys

ElectSys, a short term for Election System, is a web application that makes managing Supreme Student Government Elections effortless as possible. It includes features such as managing list of voters, candidates and parties; processing electoral votes real-time as students cast their electronic ballots; and to generate and print election results upon closing the Election in few clicks.

This application was implemented during the SSG General Elections in Plaridel National High School last February 11, 2020. Development for v2 using newer technologies is temporarily discontinued due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, making the system unusable with the implementation of distance modular learning.
