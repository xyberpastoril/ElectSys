# ElectSys

ElectSys, a short term for Election System, is a web application that makes managing Supreme Student Government Elections effortless as possible. It includes features such as managing list of voters, candidates and parties; processing electoral votes real-time as students cast their electronic ballots; and to generate and print election results upon closing the Election in few clicks.

This application was implemented during the SSG General Elections in Plaridel National High School last February 11, 2020. 

## Installation

1. Change Server Address to Static IP on Local Area Connection Settings of Adapter (Outside of DHCP Scope).
2. Install XAMPP (v7.4).
3. Delete `htdocs` contents and clone this repository to that directory.
4. Initialize XAMPP and have it autostarted by startup.
5. Start XAMPP and visit this link: http://localhost (if using the web server), or the web server's static IP address. This will initialize the first time setup.
6. Follow instructions and install the application.

## Future Development
Development for v2 using newer technologies was temporarily discontinued due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, making the system unusable with the implementation of distance modular learning. This may be improved to support tertiary-level (university/college-wide) student council elections.
